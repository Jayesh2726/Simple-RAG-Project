Normal skin is a balanced skin type that is neither too dry nor too oily, and often considered the ideal or “healthy” skin type. It typically has small pores, a smooth texture, minimal blemishes, and a radiant complexion. Normal skin is well-hydrated with balanced sebum production and generally shows low reactivity to environmental stressors or skincare products. It is also referred to as well-balanced or eudermic skin.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Healthy or normal skin has an even texture and tone with minimal visible pores, balanced moisture and oil levels, and a smooth surface. It doesn’t appear flaky or excessively shiny, and is less prone to frequent breakouts, dryness, or sensitivities. Individuals with normal skin often experience a soft, supple feel and radiant complexion that reflects good hydration and healthy barrier function.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

    section: "Moisture and Oil Balance",
    content: `
One of the defining features of normal skin is the balance between water (moisture) and lipid (oil) content. This ideal balance helps maintain a soft and smooth appearance without dryness or oiliness. The skin retains moisture effectively and regulates sebum production so it neither becomes too tight nor too greasy.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

    disease: "Normal Skin",
    section: "Barrier Function",
    content: `
Normal skin has a well-functioning protective barrier that helps keep harmful microbes and environmental irritants out while retaining essential moisture. This barrier includes an acid mantle and natural oils that maintain a slightly acidic pH, allowing it to defend against pathogens and maintain comfort and elasticity.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

    content: `
Although normal skin is less reactive, maintaining its health requires a proper skincare routine. Daily cleansing with a gentle cleanser helps remove dirt and impurities. Moisturizing helps retain hydration, and daily use of broad-spectrum sunscreen protects against UV damage and aging. A minimal skincare routine often suffices, focusing on balance rather than treatment of specific concerns.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
