Measles is a highly contagious, serious airborne disease caused by a virus that can lead to severe complications and death.

Measles vaccination averted nearly 59 million deaths between 2000 and 2024.

Even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available, in 2024 there were an estimated 95,000 measles deaths globally, mostly among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children under 5 years of age.

The proportion of children receiving a first dose of measles vaccine was 84% in 2024, slightly below the 2019 level of 86%.

Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications and even death.

Measles can affect anyone but is most common in children.

It infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body.

Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, major epidemics occurred every two to three years and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths annually.

Accelerated immunization activities prevented an estimated 59 million deaths between 2000 and 2024. Deaths declined from 780,000 in 2000 to 95,000 in 2024.

    content: `
Symptoms usually begin 10–14 days after exposure.

Early symptoms lasting 4–7 days include:
- Runny nose
- Cough
- Red and watery eyes
- Small white spots inside the cheeks

The rash appears 7–18 days after exposure, starting on the face and neck, spreading to the hands and feet over 3 days. It lasts about 5–6 days before fading.

Complications may include:
- Blindness
- Encephalitis (brain swelling)
- Severe diarrhoea and dehydration
- Ear infections
- Pneumonia

Complications are most common in children under 5 and adults over 30, especially those malnourished or immunocompromised.

    content: `
Any non-immune person (unvaccinated or without immunity) can become infected.

Unvaccinated young children and pregnant persons are at highest risk of severe complications.

Measles is common in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, especially in countries with weak health infrastructure.

Children with malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, HIV or weakened immune systems are at highest risk of death.

    section: "Transmission",
    content: `
Measles spreads through contact with infected nasal or throat secretions or by breathing contaminated air.

The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours.

One infected person can infect up to 18 others.

An infected person can transmit measles from four days before the rash appears to four days after.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles.

Care focuses on relieving symptoms, ensuring hydration and preventing complications.

Doctors may use antibiotics to treat secondary infections such as pneumonia or ear infections.

All children and adults with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements 24 hours apart. This helps prevent eye damage and may reduce measles-related deaths.

    content: `
Community-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles.

Children should receive two doses of the measles vaccine. The first dose is typically given at 9–15 months depending on the country, and the second dose later in childhood.

The measles vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive, costing less than US$1 per child.

In 2024, 76% of children received both doses and 84% received at least one dose. However, around 30 million infants remained under-protected.

Mass immunization campaigns and routine vaccination are crucial to prevent outbreaks, especially among refugees and in emergency settings.
